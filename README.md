# GoughReports
Standard reports created from Gough Island databases for monthly, annual, and species-specific reporting.

This repository contains the R and Rmd files used to automatically create reports of the bird monitoring activities undertaken by the RSPB on Gough Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. These scripts read in data held in three separate Access databases, which are NOT hosted in this repository but must be obtained elsewhere for the scripts to run.
